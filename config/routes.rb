  # Sample of regular route:

  # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

  # This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)

  # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  #   resources :products do
