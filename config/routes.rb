  # Sample of regular route:

  # Sample of named route:
  #   match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase

  # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  #   resources :products do

  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
